- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Chucky2401. I'm born in July the 20th in 1989 in France.
I work as a system administrator for an international healthcare industry.

- ðŸ‘€ I like everything in IT, like dev (C++, Qt, PowerShell), manage OS and help people around me.
I like video-games and to make some videos about my gaming session on my Youtube Channel 'Tristan JVShow'.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# for my own purpose, and maybe for something useful in my job and my coworkers.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Twitter or Facebook with my Youtube account.
